# Simple-GPS-Tracking-System used for the Tiva C series EK-TM4C123GH6PM Launchpad development board

It tracks the total distance travelled and outputs it on a 16x2 LCD screen; it also turns a green LED on when you reach a desired distance (Default = 100).
When distance travelled reaches the desired distance (100), it will stop counting and an error counter will start.


This code can be flashed through both Keil uVision4 and Energia.

This is only a small project made by a group of students for university coursework.
